Machine Learning Projects: Decision Tree and Random Forest


This repository contains machine learning projects to demonstrate the use of the decision tree and random forest algorithm in

 predicting outcomes based on input data. The projects are designed to help beginners understand the basics of those two algorithms and how to apply it to real-world problems.

## Project 1: Decision Trees and Random Forest for Kyphosis Data

Overview

This project focuses on the application of Decision Trees and Random Forests to analyze the Kyphosis dataset. Kyphosis is a condition characterized by an excessive curvature of the spine, and this dataset contains postoperative data to predict the presence of kyphosis.

### Objectives

    To build Decision Tree and Random Forest models to classify the presence of kyphosis.
    To evaluate the models' performance using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

### Dataset

    Source: The dataset used in this project is publicly available and consists of postoperative data of patients.
    Features: Age, Number, Start (various parameters related to the surgery and patient's condition).

### Methodology

    Data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA).
    Building and tuning Decision Tree and Random Forest models.
    Model evaluation and interpretation of results.

### Results

Both models achieved significant accuracy and provided insights into the key features influencing the presence of kyphosis. Random Forest demonstrated slightly better performance and robustness compared to the Decision Tree model.

## Project 2: Decision Trees and Random Forest for Lending Club Loan Data

### Overview

In this project, I applied Decision Trees and Random Forest techniques to the Lending Club loan dataset to predict loan defaults. Lending Club provides a rich dataset that includes borrower details, loan attributes, and payment history.

### Objectives

    To develop Decision Tree and Random Forest models to predict the likelihood of loan defaults.
    To assess the importance of various features in predicting loan defaults.

### Dataset

    Source: The Lending Club loan dataset is available through Kaggle or the Lending Club website.
    Features: Includes attributes such as loan amount, term, interest rate, installment, grade, employment length, and more.

### Methodology

    Data cleaning, preprocessing, and EDA.
    Building and optimizing Decision Tree and Random Forest models.
    Evaluation of model performance using metrics like accuracy, ROC-AUC score, and feature importance analysis.

### Results

Both models demonstrated robust performance in predicting loan defaults, with the Random Forest model slightly outperforming the Decision Tree model. Feature importance analysis revealed the most significant factors contributing to loan risk.
