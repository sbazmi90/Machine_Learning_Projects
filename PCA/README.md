Machine Learning Projects: Principle Component Analysis (PCA)


Welcome to my GitHub repository showcasing two projects utilizing PCA. 


## Project: PCA on Tumor Data for Feature Importance

### Overview

This project applies Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to the breast cancer dataset previously used in a Support Vector Machine 

(SVM) project. The goal is to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset and identify which features are most important for 

predicting whether a tumor is malignant or benign.

### Objectives

To perform PCA on the breast cancer dataset to reduce the number of features.

To identify the principal components that contribute the most to model prediction.

To visualize the results and understand the significance of each feature.

### Dataset

Source: The dataset is publicly available and contains features related to the characteristics of cell nuclei present in tumors.

Features: Includes attributes such as radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, compactness, and more.

### Methodology

Data preprocessing to prepare the dataset for PCA.

Performing PCA to reduce dimensionality and identify key features.

Visualization of principal components to interpret their impact on the classification of tumors.

### Results

PCA effectively reduced the dimensionality of the dataset while retaining most of the variance. 

The analysis revealed the most influential features that contribute to the classification of tumors as malignant or benign.
