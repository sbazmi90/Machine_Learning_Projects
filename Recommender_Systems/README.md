Machine Learning Projects: Recommender System


Welcome to my GitHub repository showcasing two projects utilizing PCA. 


## Project: Movie Recommender System

### Overview

This project focuses on developing a recommender system using a movie database to suggest films that users might enjoy based on 

their ratings. The system leverages collaborative filtering techniques to recommend movies that are similar to those a user has 

rated highly.

### Objectives

To build a recommender system that suggests movies based on user ratings.

To apply collaborative filtering to predict user preferences.

To evaluate the effectiveness of the recommendations using various metrics.

### Dataset

Source: The dataset includes movie ratings provided by users, along with additional movie information such as genre, release date, and more.

Features: User IDs, movie IDs, ratings, and other metadata related to the movies.

### Methodology

Data preprocessing to clean and organize the movie ratings.

Implementing collaborative filtering to build the recommender system.

Evaluating the performance of the recommendations using metrics like RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) and precision-recall.

### Results

The recommender system effectively suggested movies that align with users' preferences, demonstrating the potential of 

collaborative filtering in creating personalized movie recommendations.
