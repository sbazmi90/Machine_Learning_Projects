Machine Learning Projects: Natural Language Processing (NLP)


Welcome to my GitHub repository showcasing two projects NLP. 


## Project 1: Spam vs. Ham Classification

### Overview

This project focuses on building a model to classify messages as either spam or ham (non-spam) using Natural Language Processing 

techniques. The ability to automatically filter spam is crucial for improving the user experience in communication platforms.

### Objectives

To preprocess and clean text data to make it suitable for modeling.

To build a classification model to distinguish between spam and ham messages.

To evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

### Dataset

Source: The dataset consists of text messages labeled as either spam or ham.

Features: Text of the messages, with spam/ham labels as the target variable.

### Methodology

Text preprocessing including tokenization, stop word removal, and vectorization.

Building a classification model using algorithms such as Naive Bayes or Support Vector Machine (SVM).

Evaluation of the model's effectiveness in accurately classifying messages.

### Results

The classification model achieved high accuracy in identifying spam messages, demonstrating the effectiveness of NLP techniques 
in text classification tasks.





## Project 2: Yelp Movie Review Rating Prediction

### Overview

In this project, Natural Language Processing techniques are applied to analyze Yelp reviews and predict the ratings given by 

users. The goal is to understand how text data (reviews) correlates with the numerical ratings users assign to movies.

### Objectives

To preprocess and clean Yelp review data for analysis.

To build a predictive model to determine the rating based on the text of the review.

To evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as F1-score.

### Dataset

Source: The dataset includes Yelp reviews and associated ratings for movies.

Features: Text of the reviews, with numerical ratings as the target variable.

### Methodology

Text preprocessing including tokenization, stop word removal, and vectorization.

Building a regression model to predict ratings based on review text.

Model evaluation using appropriate regression metrics.

### Results

The predictive model provided valuable insights into the relationship between review text and ratings, successfully predicting 

the ratings with reasonable accuracy.
