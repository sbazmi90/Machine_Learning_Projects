Machine Learning Projects: K Nearest Neighbors (KNN)


This repository contains simple machine learning projects to demonstrate the use of the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm in

 predicting outcomes based on input data. The projects are designed to help beginners understand the basics of KNN and how to 
 
 apply it to real-world problems.

## Project 1: Classification with KNN

Introduction

In this project, we aim to classify data points into different categories using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. KNN is a simple, non-parametric, and lazy learning algorithm that stores all available cases and classifies new cases based on a similarity measure.

Model

We will use the KNN algorithm for classification, which will identify the category of a data point based on the majority category among its k-nearest neighbors.

Usage

    Load the dataset.
    Standardize the features using the StandardScaler from the sklearn.preprocessing library.
    Split the data into training and testing sets.
    Train the KNN model on the training data using sklearn.neighbors.KNeighborsClassifier.
    Evaluate the model on the testing data.
    Use the model to classify new data points.

## Project 2: classification with KNN

Introduction

In this project, we aim to predict continuous outcomes using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm for classification. KNN classification predicts the value of a target variable based on the average (or weighted average) of the values of its k-nearest neighbors.

Model

We will use the KNN algorithm for classification, which will predict the value of a data point based on the average value of its k-nearest neighbors.

Usage

    Load the dataset.
    Standardize the features using the StandardScaler from the sklearn.preprocessing library.
    Split the data into training and testing sets.
    Train the KNN model on the training data using sklearn.neighbors.KNeighborsRegressor.
    Evaluate the model on the testing data.
    Use the model to predict continuous outcomes for new data points.
