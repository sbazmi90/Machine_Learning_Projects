Project 1: Housing Price Prediction
Introduction

Alex, a real estate agent in Toronto, needs a model to predict housing prices based on certain features of the house. This project uses linear regression to create a model that predicts the price of a house based on various attributes of the house and its location.
Data

The dataset used for this project is Toronto_Housing.csv, which contains information about houses in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA).
Features

The dataset includes the following columns:

    Avg. Area Income: Average income of residents in the area where the house is located.
    Avg. Area House Age: Average age of houses in the same area.
    Avg. Area Number of Rooms: Average number of rooms in houses in the same area.
    Avg. Area Number of Bedrooms: Average number of bedrooms in houses in the same area.
    Area Population: Population of the area where the house is located.
    Price: Price at which the house was sold.
    Address: Address of the house.

Model

A linear regression model is used to predict the Price of a house based on the other features in the dataset.
Usage

    Load the dataset.
    Preprocess the data if necessary.
    Split the data into training and testing sets.
    Train the linear regression model on the training data.
    Evaluate the model on the testing data.
    Use the model to predict the price of a house given its features.

Project 2: Ecommerce Customer Analysis
Introduction

A clothing company wants to determine whether to focus their efforts on improving their mobile app experience or their website. This project uses linear regression to analyze customer data and provide insights into where the company should focus its efforts.
Data

The dataset used for this project is Ecommerce Customers.csv, which contains customer information and usage statistics.
Features

The dataset includes the following columns:

    Avg. Session Length: Average length of in-store style advice sessions.
    Time on App: Average time spent on the mobile app in minutes.
    Time on Website: Average time spent on the website in minutes.
    Length of Membership: Number of years the customer has been a member.

Model

A linear regression model is used to predict customer behavior and provide insights into whether the company should focus on the mobile app or the website.
Usage

    Load the dataset.
    Preprocess the data if necessary.
    Split the data into training and testing sets.
    Train the linear regression model on the training data.
    Evaluate the model on the testing data.
    Use the model to analyze customer behavior and provide insights.
