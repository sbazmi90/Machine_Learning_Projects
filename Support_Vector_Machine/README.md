Machine Learning Projects: Support Vector Machine


This repository contains machine learning projects to demonstrate the use of the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm in

 predicting  (categorizing) outcomes based on input data. 

## Project 1: SVM for Tumor Classification (Malignant or Benign)

### Overview

This project focuses on using Support Vector Machines to classify tumors as malignant or benign based on various features. Accurate classification is crucial for early detection and treatment of cancer.
Objectives

    To build an SVM model to classify tumors as malignant or benign.
    To tune hyperparameters using GridSearchCV.
    To evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

### Dataset

    Source: The dataset is publicly available and contains features related to the characteristics of cell nuclei present in tumors.
    Features: Includes attributes such as radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, compactness, and more.

### Methodology

    Data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA).
    Building and tuning an SVM model using GridSearchCV.
    Model evaluation and interpretation of results.

### Results

The SVM model achieved high accuracy in classifying tumors, demonstrating its effectiveness in distinguishing between malignant and benign cases. GridSearchCV helped in identifying the best hyperparameters, enhancing the model's performance.

    
## Project 2: SVM for Iris Species Classification

### Overview

In this project, I applied Support Vector Machines to the famous Iris dataset to classify different species of Iris flowers based on their sepal and petal dimensions.

### Objectives

    To develop an SVM model to predict the species of Iris flowers.
    To tune hyperparameters using GridSearchCV.
    To evaluate the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

### Dataset

    Source: The Iris dataset is a well-known dataset available from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
    Features: Sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

### Methodology

    Data cleaning, preprocessing, and EDA.
    Building and optimizing an SVM model using GridSearchCV.
    Evaluation of model performance using various metrics.

### Results

The SVM model accurately classified the Iris species, showcasing the model's capability to handle multiclass classification problems effectively. GridSearchCV was instrumental in finding the optimal hyperparameters, improving the model's accuracy.
