This repository contains Neural Networks projects to demonstrate the use of the ANN algorithms in

 predicting  (categorizing) outcomes based on input data. We are using Tensorflow version 2.

## Project 1: Handwritten Digit Recognition with MNIST

### Overview

This project utilizes the MNIST dataset, a collection of handwritten digits, to build a neural 

network model capable of recognizing and classifying these digits.

The MNIST dataset is a benchmark in the field of machine learning and computer vision.

### Dataset

    Source: The MNIST dataset contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images of handwritten digits (0-9).
    Features: Each image is a 28x28 pixel grayscale image representing a single digit.

### Methodology

    Data normalization and reshaping of images.
    Building a neural network model using libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch.
    Training the model and evaluating its performance on the test set.

### Results

The neural network successfully achieved a high classification accuracy on the MNIST test set, 
demonstrating the effectiveness of deep learning in image recognition tasks.

    To build and train a neural network model for binary classification.
    To evaluate the model's performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

### Dataset

    Source: The dataset includes various bank-related features relevant to the classification task.
    Features: Entropy, kurtosis, skewness, variance, among others.

### Methodology

    Data cleaning and preprocessing to prepare features for training.
    Constructing a neural network model to predict binary outcomes.
    Evaluating the model using appropriate classification metrics.

### Results

The neural network demonstrated the capability to predict labels effectively, 
providing insights into the relationships between the features and the target variable.
